### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Title Case

Title case is a naming convention where the first letter of each word is capitalized. Title case is used in programming to name variables and functions.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to title case is done by splitting the string into words, capitalizing the first letter of each word, and joining the words back together.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to title case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> Hello, World
-> Hello World
```
