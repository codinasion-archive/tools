### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Constant Case

Constant case is a naming convention where all letters are capitalized and words are separated by underscores. Constant case is used in programming to name constants.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to constant case is done by splitting the string into words, capitalizing all letters of each word, and joining the words back together with underscores.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to constant case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> HELLO, WORLD
-> HELLO_WORLD
```
