### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Kebab Case

Kebab case is a naming convention where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by hyphens. Kebab case is used in programming to name variables and functions.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to kebab case is done by splitting the string into words, lowercasing all letters of each word, and joining the words back together with hyphens.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to kebab case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> hello, world
-> hello-world
```
