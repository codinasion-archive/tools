### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Camel Case

Camel case is a naming convention where the first letter of each word is capitalized. Camel case is used in programming to name variables and functions.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to camel case is done by splitting the string into words, capitalizing the first letter of each word, and joining the words back together.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to camel case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> Hello, World
-> HelloWorld
```
