### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Dot Case

Dot case is a naming convention where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by dots. Dot case is used in programming to name files.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to dot case is done by splitting the string into words, lowercasing all letters of each word, and joining the words back together with dots.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to dot case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> hello, world
-> hello.world
```
