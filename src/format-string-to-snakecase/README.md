### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Snake Case

Snake case is a naming convention where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by underscores. Snake case is used in programming to name variables and functions.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to snake case is done by splitting the string into words, lowercasing all letters of each word, and joining the words back together with underscores.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to snake case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> hello, world
-> hello_world
```
