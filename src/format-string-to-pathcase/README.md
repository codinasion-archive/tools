### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Path Case

Path case is a naming convention where all letters are lowercase and words are separated by slashes. Path case is used in programming to name files and directories.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to path case is done by splitting the string into words, lowercasing all letters of each word, and joining the words back together with slashes.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to path case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> hello, world
-> hello/world
```
