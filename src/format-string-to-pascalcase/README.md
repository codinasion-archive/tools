### String

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used in programming to store text.

### Pascal Case

Pascal case is a naming convention where the first letter of each word is capitalized. Pascal case is used in programming to name classes and types.

### Conversion

The conversion from string to pascal case is done by splitting the string into words, capitalizing the first letter of each word, and joining the words back together.

For example, the string `hello world` is converted to pascal case as follows:

```text
hello world
-> hello, world
-> Hello, World
-> HelloWorld
```
